# Decision Trees - Building and Selecting Attributes

This README.md file provides an overview of building decision trees and selecting attributes based on the provided drug dataset. The process involves recursive partitioning and aims to classify data effectively. The key focus is on determining the best and most predictive attribute for splitting the data.

## Attribute Selection Importance
When building a decision tree, it is crucial to identify the attribute that will yield the most informative split. The selection should be based on the purity of the resulting branches. By examining different attributes, such as cholesterol and sex, the goal is to decrease the impurity and randomness in the data.

## Entropy and Impurity
Entropy is a measure of information disorder or randomness in the data. In decision trees, the goal is to minimize entropy to create more homogeneous nodes. An entropy value of 0 indicates complete homogeneity, where all data falls into a specific category. Conversely, an entropy of 1 indicates equal division of samples. The entropy of a node can be calculated using the frequency table of the attribute and the following formula:

```
Entropy = -Î£ (P * log2(P))
```

where P represents the proportion or ratio of a category (e.g., drug A or drug B). Calculating entropy is typically done using libraries or packages, and manual calculations are not necessary.

## Information Gain
Information gain measures the increase in certainty achieved by splitting the data based on a specific attribute. It is calculated as the difference between the entropy of the tree before and after the split, weighted by the proportion of samples falling under each leaf. The formula for information gain is as follows:

```
Information Gain = Entropy before split - Weighted Entropy after split
```

Building the Decision Tree
To build a decision tree, the attribute with the highest information gain is selected as the first splitter. Subsequently, the process is repeated for each branch, testing the remaining attributes to identify the next attribute that results in more pure leaves. This iterative approach ensures the creation of a decision tree with increasingly pure and informative nodes.

Conclusion
Building decision trees involves recursively partitioning the data based on attribute selection. The aim is to decrease impurity and randomness while increasing the certainty and information gain. By calculating entropy and selecting attributes with the highest information gain, a decision tree can be constructed to effectively classify the data.
