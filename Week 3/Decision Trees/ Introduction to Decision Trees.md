# Introduction to Decision Trees

To understand decision trees, let's consider a scenario. Imagine you are a medical researcher working on a study involving patients who have suffered from the same illness. These patients have been treated with either drug A or drug B. Your task is to build a model that can predict which drug would be suitable for future patients with the same illness. The dataset includes features like age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol of the patients, with the target variable being the drug they responded to. This dataset represents a binary classification problem, where we can train a decision tree on the available data to predict the appropriate drug for new patients.

## Constructing a Decision Tree

Decision trees are built by splitting the training set into distinct nodes, where each node represents a category of the data. In the case of prescribing drugs to new patients, the decision to choose drug A or B is influenced by the patient's situation. We start by considering the patient's age, which can be categorized as young, middle-aged, or senior. If the patient is middle-aged, we immediately prescribe drug B. However, for young or senior patients, we require more information to make an informed decision. Additional decision variables, such as cholesterol levels, gender, or blood pressure, can help us determine the appropriate drug. For example, if the patient is female, we recommend drug A, while for males, we suggest drug B. 

## Understanding Decision Tree Structure

Decision trees involve testing attributes and branching the cases based on the results of these tests. Each internal node of the tree corresponds to a test, and each branch represents the outcome of the test. Ultimately, each leaf node assigns a patient to a specific class or category. The decision tree structure allows us to make predictions based on a patient's characteristics and assign them to the appropriate drug class.

## Building a Decision Tree

To build a decision tree, we consider the attributes one by one. We start by choosing an attribute from the dataset and calculating its significance in splitting the data. In subsequent steps, we split the data based on the value of the best attribute and repeat this process for the remaining attributes. This iterative approach helps us construct the decision tree. Once the tree is built, it can be used to predict the class of unknown cases, allowing us to determine the proper drug for a new patient based on their characteristics.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, decision trees are a powerful tool for classification tasks. They enable us to make informed decisions based on a set of attributes. By following a systematic process of attribute selection and data splitting, we can construct decision trees that provide accurate predictions. In the next video, we will delve into calculating the significance of attributes in the data splitting process. Thank you for watching!
