# Multi-class Prediction in Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification tasks. While SVM is primarily designed for binary classification, there are techniques to extend it for multi-class classification. In this article, we will explore three popular approaches for multi-class classification using SVM: SoftMax Regression, One-vs-All, and One-vs-One.

## SoftMax Regression
SoftMax regression, also known as multinomial logistic regression, is a generalization of logistic regression for multi-class classification. It extends the concept of logistic regression by converting the distances between input data points and class parameters into probabilities. The SoftMax function is used to calculate the probabilities of each class.

The SoftMax function takes the dot product of the input vector (x) with each of the class parameters (Î¸) for K classes, where K is the number of classes. The resulting values are exponentiated and normalized to obtain the probabilities for each class. The predicted class is then determined by selecting the class with the highest probability using the argmax function.

SoftMax regression can be visualized by plotting the hyperplanes corresponding to each class. The regions where the value of the dot product is largest represent the areas where a sample would be classified as a particular class. By comparing the probabilities of different classes, we can determine the predicted class for a given input.

## One-vs-All (One-vs-Rest)
One-vs-All classification, also known as One-vs-Rest, is a technique that extends binary classifiers like logistic regression or SVM to handle multi-class classification. It involves training K classifiers, where K is the number of classes. For each classifier, the data is split into two classes: the class to be classified and the rest of the classes combined into a "dummy" class.

To make a prediction, each classifier is applied to the input data, and the class with the highest probability or the majority vote is selected as the predicted class. The probabilities generated for the dummy class are disregarded. This approach allows us to use binary classifiers to solve multi-class classification problems.

One-vs-All classification has some limitations, such as ambiguous regions where multiple classes may be predicted. Various methods can be used to address this issue, including fusion rules based on the output of the linear function or the probability scores of each class.

## One-vs-One
In One-vs-One classification, we create a separate classifier for each pair of classes in the dataset. For example, if there are K classes, we need to train K(K-1)/2 classifiers. Each classifier is trained on the samples from two classes, and the separating plane or hyperplane is determined to distinguish between those classes.

During prediction, each classifier is applied to the input data, and the class with the most votes or the highest number of positive predictions is selected as the predicted class. One-vs-One classification requires training multiple classifiers but can be effective in solving multi-class classification problems.

## Conclusion
In summary, multi-class classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) can be achieved through various techniques such as SoftMax regression, One-vs-All, and One-vs-One. Each approach has its advantages and considerations. SoftMax regression extends logistic regression to handle multiple classes, while One-vs-All and One-vs-One strategies use binary classifiers to solve multi-class problems. Understanding these techniques can help practitioners effectively apply SVM for multi-class prediction tasks.
