# Supervised Learning vs. Unsupervised Learning
This readme file provides an introduction to the concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves observing and directing the execution of a machine learning model. Instead of supervising a person, we supervise the model to predict future instances accurately. To teach a model, we train it using labeled data from a dataset. In a labeled dataset, each instance is associated with a known class or category. Attributes represent the names of features, which can be numeric or categorical. The two types of supervised learning techniques are:

- **Classification**: Predicting discrete class labels or categories.
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values.
For example, using a dataset of car attributes like engine size and cylinders, regression can predict the CO2 emission of a new car.

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning involves letting the model work on its own to discover hidden patterns or information. It trains on unlabeled data and draws conclusions without human supervision. Unsupervised learning is more challenging as it has less information about the data and expected outcomes. Common unsupervised learning techniques include:

- **Dimension reduction**: Reducing redundant features to simplify classification.
- **Market basket analysis**: Identifying associations between groups of items.
- **Density estimation**: Exploring data to find underlying structure.
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points or objects.
Clustering is widely used for tasks like customer segmentation or organizing music preferences. Unsupervised learning is valuable for discovering structure, summarization, and anomaly detection.

## Key Differences
The main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning lies in the type of data they work with. Supervised learning utilizes labeled data, while unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. Supervised learning includes classification and regression algorithms, while unsupervised learning focuses on techniques like clustering. Compared to supervised learning, unsupervised learning has fewer models and evaluation methods, making it a less controllable environment where the machine generates outcomes.
