# Accuracy Metrics for Model Evaluation in Regression

Welcome to the "Accuracy Metrics for Model Evaluation" section of the course! In this section, we will explore various evaluation metrics used in regression models to assess their performance. These metrics play a crucial role in understanding the strengths and areas of improvement for a model. Let's dive in!

## Understanding Model Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation metrics are essential for measuring the accuracy of a regression model. By comparing the actual values with the predicted values, we can determine how well the model performs. In regression, the error of the model refers to the difference between the data points and the trend line generated by the algorithm. There are multiple ways to calculate errors, and we will focus on several key metrics.

## Common Evaluation Metrics
1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE is the mean of the absolute values of the errors. It provides a straightforward measure of the average error between the predicted and actual values. It is calculated using the formula:

   MAE = (1/n) * Σ|y - y_hat|

   where:
   - n is the number of data points
   - y is the actual value
   - y_hat is the predicted value

2. Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE is the mean of the squared errors. It is more popular than MAE as it places greater emphasis on larger errors. It is calculated using the formula:

   MSE = (1/n) * Σ(y - y_hat)^2

3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE is the square root of MSE. It is one of the most commonly used evaluation metrics in regression. RMSE is interpretable in the same units as the response variable (Y units), making it easier to relate and understand its information. It is calculated using the formula:

   RMSE = √(MSE)

4. Relative Absolute Error (RAE) and Relative Squared Error (RSE): RAE and RSE are normalization techniques for error calculation. RAE divides the total absolute error by the total absolute error of a simple predictor, while RSE is similar but widely adopted for calculating R-squared. The formulas are:

   RAE = Σ|y - y_hat| / Σ|y - y_mean|

   RSE = Σ(y - y_hat)^2 / Σ(y - y_mean)^2

   where:
   - y is the actual value
   - y_hat is the predicted value
   - y_mean is the mean of the actual values

5. R-squared: R-squared is not an error metric per se but is widely used for assessing model accuracy. It represents how closely the data values align with the fitted regression line. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data. It is calculated using the formula:

   R-squared = 1 - (SSR / SST)

   where:
   - SSR is the sum of squared residuals (Σ(y - y_hat)^2)
   - SST is the total sum of squares (Σ(y - y_mean)^2)

## Choosing the Right Metric
The selection of an appropriate evaluation metric depends on various factors, such as the model type, data characteristics, and domain knowledge. Each metric offers a different perspective on the model's predictive performance. It is crucial to consider the specific requirements and objectives of your project when deciding which metric to utilize.
