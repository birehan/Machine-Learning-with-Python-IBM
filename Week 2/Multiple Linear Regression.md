## Multiple Linear Regression - Key Concepts

This README.md file provides an overview of multiple linear regression, covering its applications, model representation, parameter estimation, and prediction phase. Here are the key concepts discussed in this document:

### Introduction to Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression, where multiple independent variables are used to predict a continuous dependent variable. It is used in two main applications: determining the effect of independent variables on the dependent variable and predicting the impact of changes in independent variables on the dependent variable.

### Model Representation and Parameters
In multiple linear regression, the target variable (Y) is expressed as a linear combination of independent variables (X). The model is represented as follows: Y_hat = θ₀ + θ₁X₁ + θ₂X₂ + ... + θₙXₙ, where θ₀, θ₁, θ₂, ..., θₙ are the coefficients or parameters of the model. The goal is to find the best-fit hyperplane for the data by estimating the optimal parameter values.

### Parameter Estimation
To estimate the parameters, various approaches can be used. One common method is ordinary least squares (OLS), which minimizes the mean squared error (MSE). OLS treats the data as a matrix and utilizes linear algebra operations to estimate the optimal parameter values. Another approach is optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, which iteratively minimizes the error by adjusting the coefficients.

### Model Evaluation and Error
The quality of the multiple linear regression model is assessed using error metrics. The mean squared error (MSE) is a popular metric that measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. The objective is to minimize the MSE by finding the best parameters for the model. Lower MSE values indicate a better fit of the model to the data.

### Prediction Phase
Once the parameters of the linear equation are determined, the model can be used for prediction. By plugging in specific values of the independent variables into the model equation, the dependent variable can be predicted. The relative importance of predictors can be assessed based on the coefficients, indicating how each independent variable impacts the outcome variable.

It is important to consider the number of independent variables used, avoid overfitting the model, and ensure a linear relationship exists between the dependent variable and each independent variable. Further exploration of techniques for handling overfitting and checking linearity is recommended.

By understanding and applying multiple linear regression, you can gain insights into the effects and relationships among multiple variables and make predictions based on the learned model.
