# Introduction to Regression
Regression is a predictive modeling technique used to estimate a continuous value based on one or more independent variables. In the context of CO2 emissions from cars, we can use regression to predict the emission levels using variables such as engine size or number of cylinders. The goal is to build a regression estimation model using historical data and then utilize the model to estimate the CO2 emission for new or unknown cars.

# Types of Regression Models
There are two main types of regression models: simple regression and multiple regression. Simple regression involves using a single independent variable to estimate the dependent variable, which can be either linear or non-linear. For example, we can predict CO2 emission using engine size as the independent variable. On the other hand, multiple regression comes into play when there is more than one independent variable, such as predicting CO2 emission using both engine size and number of cylinders. The linearity or non-linearity of the regression model depends on the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

# Applications of Regression Analysis
Regression analysis finds application in various fields, including sales forecasting, psychology, real estate, and income prediction. For instance, in sales forecasting, one can predict a salesperson's yearly sales based on factors like age, education, and years of experience. Regression analysis can also help determine individual satisfaction levels using demographic and psychological factors. Additionally, it can be utilized to estimate house prices based on attributes like size and number of bedrooms, or predict employment income using variables such as hours of work, education, occupation, and more. These examples demonstrate the versatility and practicality of regression analysis in different domains.

# Exploring Regression Techniques
There are numerous regression algorithms available, each with its own significance and specific conditions under which it is best suited. While this course covers only a few regression techniques, it provides a solid foundation for exploring and understanding different regression methods. By gaining this fundamental knowledge, you can delve deeper into various regression techniques and their applications in fields such as finance, healthcare, retail, and many more.
